This is Magma code to carry out quadratic Chabauty for curves X/Q of genus > 1 over the
rationals satisfying the following conditions
* rank = genus
* real multiplication
* enough rational points on the curve to solve for the height pairing, unless the genus is 2.
* ps is a prime of good reduction such that 
  * the closure of Jac(X)(Q) in Jac(X)(Qp) has finite index
  * the Hecke operator at p generates the Hecke algebra.

The theory is described in `Quadratic Chabauty for modular curves: Algorithms and
Examples` and `Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the Split Cartan Modular Curve of Level 13`
by J.S. Balakrishnan, N. Dogra, J.S. Müller, J. Tuitman and J. Vonk.

Most of the code consists of wrappers around a slightly modified earlier version, mostly written by Jan Tuitman and based on even earlier SAGE code by Netan Dogra; the latter was hardcoded for the computations in `Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the Split Cartan Modular Curve of Level 13`. 
Also includes contributions by Jennifer Balakrishnan and Jan Vonk, as well as code for the Mordell-Weil sieve based on code due to Michael Stoll.


List of files:
-- qc_modular.m: Contains
   - QCModAffine: Main function, takes a plane affine curve (not necessarily 
      smooth) with integer coefficients, monic in y, and a prime p and outputs the rational points 
      in those disks where Tuitman's Frobenius lift is defined. Also outputs additional information, such 
      as additional p-adic solutions which don't look rational.
      Includes numerous optional arguments.
   - QCModQuartic: takes an integer polynomial defining an affine patch of a smooth plane quartic
      and outputs the rational points.
-- divisor_heights.m: Contains the function local_height_divisors_p, which computes the local height pairing
    between two divisors with disjoint support on an odd degree hyperelliptic curve (with
    various restrictions) using construction of Coleman-Gross. Essentially ports earlier Sage code due to 
    Jennifer Balakrishnan, based on Balakrishnan-Besser, `Coleman-Gross height pairings and the p-adic
    sigma function`, IMRN 2012 (This repo contains a modified copy for geometric quadratic Chabauty, 2022, to implement height pairings <D, E> such that E has support at infinity - JDR, SH, PS)
-- mws-qc.m: Implementation of the Mordell-Weil sieve based on an earlier
    version of Magma's Mordell-Weil sieve due to Michael Stoll, adapted for use in combination
    with quadratic Chabauty. Requires version >= 2.25 of magma because of code for the Mordell-Weil group
    of a genus 2 Jacobian. This code is also available on Michael Stoll's website.
-- hodge.m: Computes the Hodge filtration using the algorithm described in section 4 of 
    `Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the Split Cartan Modular Curve of Level 13`
-- frobenius.m: Computes the Frobenius structure using the algorithm described in section 4 of 
    `Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the Split Cartan Modular Curve of Level 13`
-- heights.m: Computes Nekovar heights as described in 
    `Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the Split Cartan Modular Curve of Level 13` and various
    related functions.
-- hecke_correspondence.m: Computes a Hecke operator using Eichler-Shimura and nice
    correspondences. 
-- howe-zhu: Implements the criterion of Howe-Zhu, `On the existence of
    absolutely simple abelian varieties of a given dimension over an arbitrary field`,
    JNT 2002,  to show that abelian varieties are absolutely simple.
-- symplectic_basis.m: Given a basis of H^1_dR of a smooth projective curve such that the
    first g elements generate regular differentials, computes the cup product and a
    symplectic basis with respect to the cup product.
-- second_patch_quartic.m: Given an affine patch of a smooth plane quartic, finds a second
    patch so that running quadratic Chabauty on both suffices to provably find the rational
    points on the projective model.
-- misc.m: various functions, such as an implementation of rational reconstruction of p-adic
    numbers using LLL, rank computations using Kolyvagin-Logachev, equivariant splittings of
    the Hodge filtration of H^1 and coefficients mod p^N of p-adic points under Abel-Jacobi in
    terms of generators.
-- qc_init_g2.m: Contains several functions necessary for quadratic Chabauty in genus 2
    -- find_qc_primes: computes primes for combination of QC and the MWS
    -- generators: computes generators of the Mordell-Weil group
    -- height_init_g2: computes divisors suitable to solve for the height pairing using
        local_CG_heights for local heights at p and intersections for local heights away
        from p.
-- applications.m, auxpolys.m, coho.m, coleman.m, froblift.m, reductions.m, singleintegrals.m: 
    Due to Jan Tuitman, computes Frobenius lifts and  Coleman integrals, based on 
      - Tuitman, `Counting points on curves using a map to P1`, Math. Comp. 2016
      - Tuitman, `Counting points on curves using a map to P1, II`, Finite Fields Appl, 2017
      - Balakrishnan-Tuitman, `Jennifer S. Balakrishnan and Jan Tuitman. Explicit Coleman
        integration for curves`, Math. Comp., to appear,
    with some minor modifications.  
-- Examples: Contains code and log files for the examples described in our two papers. To
    run the code, copy it into the top level folder.
